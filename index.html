The sun pierces through the skylight, illuminating the expressionist interior. A worker approaches you.
	
	&quot;It seems like you&#39;re here for the AYmazing race. Can I see your pass?&quot;

	You look at the worker in confusion. You're here for the AYMazing race, looking for a &#39;&#39;keyword&#39;&#39; somewhere.
	
	&quot;Oh, sorry, it seems like you&#39;re new here. Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll show you around. Would you please hand me your ID first? I want to make sure you&#39;re the person we&#39;re expecting to see today.&quot;
	
	[[You nod your head and hand the card to the worker.-&gt;Pass Inspection]]
	
	[[You shake your head and clench onto the card tightly.-&gt;Persuation]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2" name="Pass Inspection" tags="" position="854,48" size="100,100">&quot;Hm, that seems about right. Welcome!&quot;
	
	The worker leads you into the main hall.
	
	Upon entering, you stare in awe at the various decorations hanging from the ceiling. At the center is a goose model, hanging on a thin thread, chasing a fossilized //Pterodactylus antiquus//.
	
	&quot;In the main hall, we showcase our past events and challenge winners. In fact, you can even relive these events yourself! Unfortunately, you won&#39;t get a prize because the time period ended.&quot;
	
	You nod, zooming out from the worker&#39;s speech as you try to find where the keyword is hidden.
	
	&quot;So, do you have any questions?&quot;
	
	[[&#39;No, where is the keyword?&#39;-&gt;Pointless]]
	
	[[&#39;What does STEM stand for?&#39;-&gt;Interest]]
	
	[[&#39;Why is the goose chasing that pterodactyl?&#39;-&gt;Curiousity]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="3" name="Persuation" tags="" position="827,208" size="100,100">The worker sighs.
	
	&quot;Look, I&#39;m not going to scam you, I&#39;m 100% certified to work here. Don&#39;t believe me? Here&#39;s my work ID.&quot; 
	
	You squint at their name.
	
	&#39;Your name is &#39;&#39;WORKER 2001&#39;&#39;? That&#39;s your actual name?&#39;
	
	&quot;Hey, now that you saw my ID, I need yours. Just the card issued by the AY-mazing race hosts is fine.&quot; They avoid the question and you give in.
	
	[[You hand the card to them, still hung up on their last name being a number.-&gt;Pass Inspection]]
	</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="4" name="Pointless" tags="" position="1048,0" size="100,100">&quot;Eager to get out of this building now, are you?&quot; The worker laughs and you shrug. Time is money and the prize is important, you can&#39;t afford to waste time.
	
	&quot;Well, if you look around this building, you&#39;ll be able to find it. The hint is that the keyword is &#39;&#39;hidden in one of the QR codes around the building&#39;&#39;.&quot;
	
	You perk up at the hint and mentally note it down. 
	
	&quot;Would you like a map to help you navigate faster?&quot;
	
	[[&#39;Yes please.&#39;-&gt;Map]]
	
	[[&#39;No, I&#39;m fine, I can do this by myself. I&#39;m pretty good with directions.&#39;-&gt;Lost]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="5" name="Curiousity" tags="" position="1131,252" size="100,100">The worker chuckles.
	
	&quot;Well, it&#39;s just something our executive team thought of. They claim it is historically accurate and that &#39;since birds are basically dinosaurs, geese chasing pterodactyls are possible&#39;.&quot;
	
	You think back to the Untitled Goose Game. 
	
	&#39; &#39;&#39;Peace was never an option,&#39;&#39; &#39; you mutter. 
	
	The worker stops talking and gives you a look.
	
	&quot;The hint to getting the keyword is that &#39;&#39;it is hidden in one of the QR codes around the building&#39;&#39;.&quot;
	
	Your eyes light up from the clue and notice the map in the hands of the worker.
	
	[[&#39;May I use that map?&#39;-&gt;Map]]
	
	[[You thank the worker and run off. Who needs a map when exploring the unknown is faster?-&gt;Lost]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="6" name="Interest" tags="" position="1075,129" size="100,100">&quot;Good question. STEM stands for Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics. While it might seem like STEM is only present in the subjects they represent, that is not true. Here at STEM Clubhouse, we aim to show how STEM can be found and linked to other subjects.&quot;
	
	&#39;Interesting.&#39; You comment as you watch people file in and out of rooms. Everyone here seems to be enjoying a fun time and you remember you&#39;re part of a race. 
	
	&quot;I shouldn&#39;t hold you back any longer, since you&#39;re part of a race. Here&#39;s a hint: &#39;&#39;the keyword is hidden in one of the QR codes around the building&#39;&#39;. Would you like a map of the Clubhouse for easier navigation?&quot;
	
	[[&#39;No, I&#39;m fine.-&gt;Lost]]
	
	[[&#39;May I?&#39;-&gt;Map]]
	</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="7" name="Map" tags="" position="1375,22" size="100,100">&quot;Sure, here. Good luck!&quot; The worker waves a goodbye and walks off.
	
	[[Wow, there&#39;s quite a few rooms to visit.-&gt;Choice]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="8" name="Lost" tags="" position="1443,148" size="100,100">It&#39;s been a few minutes.
	
	No matter how many turns you take, it all leads to activity rooms, movie theatres and cafeterias. Where&#39;s the display cases?
	
	&quot;Looking for this?&quot; A janitor down the hall hands you a map. You nod and take the map, embarrassed.
	
	[[&#39;Thank you.&#39;-&gt;Choice]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="9" name="Choice" tags="" position="1575,53" size="100,100">You stare at the map and contemplate which exhibit is most likely to hold the keyword.
	
	[[The Mathematics exhibit appears to be featuring some art. Could it hold something special?-&gt;Mathematics]]
	
	[[The stage of the Art/Drama exhibit is lit. Maybe the keyword is there?-&gt;Dance and Drama]]
	
	[[The retro aesthetic of the Computers and Technology exhibit looks stunning. Could the keyword be on a neon sign there?-&gt;Computers and Technology]]
	
	[[A funky sound is coming from the concert hall. Perhaps the keyword is in the sheet music?-&gt;Music]]
	
	[[There must be something I missed in the main hall, let&#39;s go back and check.-&gt;Hall]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="10" name="Mathematics" tags="" position="1787,356" size="100,100">After taking the helical staircase, you struggle with the door. It has a grid design and a goose handle.
	
	&#39;Why is it not opening?&#39; You grit your teeth in frustration and notice a sign.
	
	THE DOOR OPENS WHEN YOU DIRECT THE HANDLE IN THE DIRECTION X[1, +INFINITY).
	
	You sigh as you look at the door&#39;s grid design and rack your brain. You remember Mr. Lim telling you something about interval notation in math class. 
	
	[[You slide the door to the left. -&gt; Open]]
	</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="11" name="Dance and Drama" tags="" position="1657,370" size="100,100">A sea of children run past you as you arrive at the theatre. The classic red curtains are pulled back to reveal dancing robots that are constantly changing their moves. 
	
	Curious, you take an empty command pad and start playing around with the robot. The silver robot on the stage wore a goose crown and you start wondering what&#39;s their deal with geese.
	
	You grit your teeth. Time is running out. Where&#39;s the keyword?
	
	[[You start to wonder if the keyword is somewhere else. -&gt;Choices - Dance]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="12" name="Computers and Technology" tags="" position="1521,381" size="100,100">The misty and dim exhibit looks like it came straight out of a video game. 
	
	You notice a neon sign that says &quot;KAHOOT EVENT GOING ON NOW&quot;.
	
	Remembering that Kahoots usually result in prizes, you run over to see if the keyword would display on the screen. 
	
	A teen honks and the friend group honks with them as they hold up the prize --- A $10 Starbucks gift card.
	
	If only you came a little earlier, maybe you would&#39;ve gotten it.
	
	Where&#39;s the keyword? You can&#39;t find it.
	
	Standing under a bright neon lights, you check your map again.
	
	[[&#39;Either I missed the keyword, or it&#39;s somewhere else.&#39; -&gt; Choices - Computer]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="13" name="Music" tags="" position="1395,381" size="100,100">The concert hall is filled with people and you decide to take a seat near the front. You sink into the chair and watch people perform.
	
	The performers whack plastic tubes on the floor, creating familiar tunes.
	
	;iFrame band here;
	
	Weird... the tubes all have the logo of a goose on it, but there&#39;s no keyword.
	
	[[&#39;Did I miss something? Let me see if the other exhibits have something.&#39; -&gt;Choices - Music]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="14" name=" Open" tags="" position="1852,99" size="100,100">The door opens and you do a silent cheer. 
	
	The room is filled with artworks created on Desmos --- an activity that was hosted by STEM Club in September.
	
	[iFrame here]
	
	Every single artwork is stunning, but... where&#39;s the keyword?
	
	[[You decide to look around to see if you can find the keyword somewhere else. -&gt;Choices - Math]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="15" name="Choices - Math" tags="" position="2028,185" size="100,100">You stare at the map and contemplate which exhibit is most likely to hold the keyword.

	You stare at the map intently.
	
	&#39;&#39;&quot;EXCLUSIVE DISCUSSION WITH DR.BURT ON FEB. 17!&quot;&#39;&#39; glows on the pamphlet and you squint at the words. There seems to be a flap under the event calendar, which you took a picture and noted down.

	The AYmazing Race has led you here. Before you go any further, you look down at your headphones and wonder if you should listen to music.
	
	It&#39;s the best to listen to music as you play this game (we made a custom soundtrack!), but in the end, it&#39;s your choice.

	&#39;&#39;&quot;With more guest speakers to come for the discussion, you can gain accurate knowledge, as they are all speaking from years of experience! Discussions and Kahoots happen monthly! Prizes guaranteed.&quot;&#39;&#39; You nod and note the information down.
	
	The mirror reflects the bottom of the goose model --- the same one that you first saw when the worker greeted you.
	
	Is that... an arrow?
	
	You dash under the model and look in the direction of the arrow.
	
	You notice a QR code on the plate the arrow is pointing at. 
	
	You eagerly scan it, bringing you to a &lt;A HREF = &quot;https://alex-cen.github.io/STEMazing-Race/&quot;&gt;(text-colour:cyan)[website]&lt;/A&gt;.
	
	So... where is the keyword?
