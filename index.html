&quot;It seems like you&#39;re here for the AY-mazing race. Can I see your pass?&quot;

You look at the worker in confusion. You chose to participate in the AY-mazing race and the hosts told you that the building behind the worker holds a &#39;&#39;keyword&#39;&#39; somewhere.

&quot;Oh, sorry, it seems like you&#39;re new here. Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll show you around. By clicking one of the choices below, you get to determine how your visit here at the STEM Club house will turn out. So, would you please hand me your pass first? I want to make sure you&#39;re the person we&#39;re expecting to see today.&quot;

[[You nod your head and hand the card to the worker.-&gt;Pass Inspection]]

[[You shake your head and clench onto the card tightly.-&gt;Persuation]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2" name="Pass Inspection" tags="" position="854,48.5" size="100,100">&quot;Hm, that seems about right. Welcome!&quot;

The worker holds out the glass door for you to enter the building. 

Upon entering the hall, you find yourself staring in awe at the various decorations hanging from the ceiling. Wait, is that a goose model chasing a fossilized //Pterodactylus antiquus//?

&quot;At STEM Club House, we showcase the highlights of our past events. In fact, you can even relive these events yourself! Unfortunately, you won&#39;t get a prize because the time period ended. However, we will still showcase your works because they deserve recognition.&quot;

You nod, zooming out from the worker&#39;s speech as you try to find where the keyword is hidden.

&quot;So, do you have any questions?&quot;

[[&#39;No, where is the keyword?&#39;-&gt;Pointless]]

[[&#39;What does STEM stand for?&#39;-&gt;Interest]]

[[&#39;Why is the goose chasing that pterodactyl?&#39;-&gt;Curiousity]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="3" name="Persuation" tags="" position="883,236.5" size="100,100">The worker sighs.

&quot;Look, I&#39;m not going to scam you, I&#39;m 100% certified to work here. Don&#39;t believe me? Here&#39;s my work ID.&quot; 

They show you their ID badge that&#39;s attached to their badge reel. It has a photo of the worker, who looked a little too eager. You squint at their name.

&#39;Your name is WORKER 2001? That&#39;s your actual name?&#39;

&quot;Hey, now that you saw my ID, I need yours. Just the card issued by the AY-mazing race hosts is fine.&quot; They avoid the question and you give in.

[[You hand the card to them, still hung up on their last name being a number.-&gt;Pass Inspection]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="4" name="Pointless" tags="" position="1048,0" size="100,100">&quot;Eager to get out of this building now, are you?&quot; The worker laughs and you shrug. Time is money and the prize is important, you can&#39;t afford to waste time.

&quot;Well, if you look around this building, you&#39;ll be able to find it. The hint is that the keyword is &#39;&#39;hidden in one of the display cases around the building&#39;&#39;.&quot;

You perk up at the hint and mentally note it down. 

&quot;Would you like a map to help you navigate faster?&quot;

[[&#39;Yes please.&#39;-&gt;Map]]

[[&#39;No, I&#39;m fine, I can do this by myself. I&#39;m pretty good with directions.&#39;-&gt;Lost]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="5" name="Curiousity" tags="" position="1129,251.5" size="100,100">The worker chuckles.

&quot;Well, it&#39;s just something our executive team thought of. They claim it is historically accurate and that &#39;since birds are basically dinosaurs, geese chasing pterodactyls are possible&#39;.&quot;

You think back to the Untitled Goose Game. &#39; &#39;&#39;Peace was never an option,&#39;&#39; &#39; you mutter. The worker gives you a look and steps away from you. They hold onto the walkie-talkie tightly, as if they&#39;re expecting you to have an outburst.

&quot;Um, anyway, I shouldn&#39;t hold you back anymore. The hint to getting the keyword is that &#39;&#39;it is hidden in one of the display cases around the building&#39;&#39;.&quot;

Your eyes light up from the clue and notice the map in the hands of the worker.

[[&#39;May I use that map?&#39;-&gt;Map]]

[[You thank the worker and run off. Who needs a map when exploring the unknown is faster?-&gt;Lost]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="6" name="Interest" tags="" position="1075,129" size="100,100">&quot;Good question. STEM stands for Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics. While it might seem like STEM is only present in the subjects they represent, that is not true. Here at STEM Club House, we aim to show how STEM can be found and linked to other subjects.&quot;

&#39;Interesting.&#39; You comment as you watch people file in and out of rooms. There are children crying to participate in events, teen groups screaming over prizes and elderly couples debating over mathematical concepts. Everyone here seems to be enjoying a fun time and you remember you&#39;re part of a race. 

&quot;I shouldn&#39;t hold you back any longer, since you&#39;re part of a race. Here&#39;s a hint: &#39;&#39;the keyword is hidden in one of the display cases around the building&#39;&#39;. Would you like a map of the Club House for easier navigation?&quot;

[[&#39;No, I&#39;m fine.-&gt;Lost]]

[[&#39;May I?&#39;-&gt;Map]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="7" name="Map" tags="" position="1376,22.5" size="100,100">&quot;Sure, here. Good luck!&quot; The worker waves a goodbye and walks off.

[[Wow, there&#39;s quite a few rooms to visit.-&gt;Choice]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="8" name="Lost" tags="" position="1443,147" size="100,100">It&#39;s been a few minutes.

No matter how many turns you take, it all leads to activity rooms, movie theatres and cafeterias. Where&#39;s the display cases?

You start feeling anxious about the time and decide to find a staff to ask for a map. Maybe you overestimated your navigation skills.

&quot;Are you lost?&quot; You turn to see a janitor wiping sweat off of their forehead. 

You nod, embarrased.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry, it happens. This building is huge and the first floor is dedicated to events and relaxation. It&#39;s because children tend to enjoy the group activites more than the actual exhibits. I still remember staying at the Science Center&#39;s Kidspark place for hours.&quot; The janitor chuckles as they hand you a map from their cart. 

&quot;Here, you&#39;re going to need this. I don&#39;t know why you&#39;re in a hurry, but please enjoy this place while you can.&quot; They give you a heartwarming smile and you accept the map.

[[&#39;Thank you, I&#39;ll be sure to.&#39;-&gt;Choice]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="9" name="Choice" tags="" position="1575,54.5" size="100,100">You stare at the map and contemplate which exhibit is most likely to hold the keyword.

[[The geometric modern designs of the Mathematics exhibit appear to be sparkling with something, could it hold something special?-&gt;Mathematics]]

[[The fancy stage on the first floor sounds like a place that might hold the keyword. Who knows, maybe the actors would recite the keyword?-&gt;Dance and Drama]]

[[The cyberpunk aesthetic of the Computers and Technology exhibit looks stunning. Could the keyword be on a neon sign there?-&gt;Computers and Technology]]

[[The miniature concert hall has potential. What if the elegant hall is handing out music sheets that have the keyword on there?-&gt;Music]]

[[There must be something I missed in the main hall, let&#39;s go back and check.-&gt;Hall]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="10" name="Mathematics" tags="" position="1792,367.5" size="100,100">After taking the helical staircase, you struggle with the door. It has a grid design and a goose handle.

&#39;Why is it not opening?&#39; You grit your teeth in frustration and notice a sign.

THE DOOR OPENS WHEN YOU DIRECT THE HANDLE IN THE DIRECTION X[1, +INFINITY).

You sigh as you look at the door&#39;s grid design and rack your brain. You remember Mr. Lim telling you something about interval notation in math class. 

[[You slide the door to the right. -&gt; Open]]

[[You slide the door to the left. -&gt; Oops]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="11" name="Dance and Drama" tags="" position="1657,370.5" size="100,100">A sea of children run past you as you arrive at the theatre. The classic red curtains are pulled back to reveal dancing robots that are constantly changing their moves. 

You notice that the kids are actually dragging blocks of code to the robot&#39;s commands to make them dance. 

Curious, you &lt;A HREF = https://studio.code.org/s/dance-2019/stage/1/puzzle/1&gt;take an empty command pad&lt;/A&gt; and start playing around with the robot.

You get bored of the robot after a while and notice a QR code beside the stage. The QR code in the middle has a picture of a goose.

Pulling out your phone, you scan it and it leads you to a &lt;A HREF = &quot;https://sites.google.com/tdsb.on.ca/ayjstem/archive/dance-drama?authuser=0&quot;&gt;website&lt;/A&gt;.

[[You start to wonder if the keyword is somewhere else. -&gt;Choices - Dance]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="12" name="Computers and Technology" tags="" position="1522,380.5" size="100,100">The misty and dim exhibit looks like it came straight out of a video game. 

You notice a neon sign that says &quot;KAHOOT EVENT GOING ON NOW&quot;.

Remembering that Kahoots usually result in prizes, you run over to see if the keyword would display on the screen. Instead, it said &quot;THANK YOU FOR PLAYING!&quot; and you shake your head, dejected. 

A teen honks and the friend group honks with them as they hold up the prize. A $10 Starbucks gift card.

If only you came a little earlier, maybe you would&#39;ve gotten it.

You notice a few computers under a neon sign that said &quot;CODE YOUR OWN GAME!&quot; and you go over to inspect it.

The computer urges you to <a href ="https://sites.google.com/tdsb.on.ca/ayjstem/archive/computer-technology" target ="_blank">click</a> on the start button, which leads you to a collection of resources teaching you how to code.

Despite creating a nice game, you realized that your time is starting to run out. Standing under a bright neon lights, you check your map again.

[[Either I missed the keyword, or it&#39;s somewhere else. -&gt; Choices - Computer]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="13" name="Music" tags="" position="1393,381.5" size="100,100">The concert hall is filled with people and you decide to take a seat near the front. You sink into the chair and watch people perform.

A person hands a sheet of paper to you and you scan it carefully. There&#39;s a gray goose watermark that peeks behind the bold print of the program. 

Boomwhackers, orchestras, bucket drumming and even singing glasses. You sit back to relax before you suddenly remember you&#39;re part of the AY-mazing race. You can&#39;t just spend time like this.

The back of the program holds a QR code that you scanned. Perhaps this holds the keyword?

It brings you to a &lt;A HREF = &quot;https://sites.google.com/tdsb.on.ca/ayjstem/archive/music?authuser=0&quot;&gt;website&lt;/A&gt; that showcases all the performances and even more.

[[&#39;Did I miss something? Let me see if the other exhibits have something.&#39; -&gt;Choices - Music]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="14" name=" Open" tags="" position="1896,65" size="100,100">The door opens and you do a silent cheer. 

There are three display cases in total, but one catches your eye the most.

The art of your favourite characters are drawn in a mathematical program called Desmos. 

You eagerly run over and check the information plate.

YOU CAN CREATE YOUR OWN DRAWINGS WITH MATH TOO &lt;A HREF = &quot;https://www.desmos.com/calculator&quot;&gt;HERE&lt;/A&gt;!

The sign also tells you to find references that are provided on this &lt;A HREF = &quot;https://sites.google.com/tdsb.on.ca/ayjstem/archive/math?authuser=0&quot;&gt;website&lt;/A&gt;.

[[You decide to look around to see if you can find the keyword somewhere else. -&gt;Choices - Math]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="15" name=" Oops" tags="" position="1741,88.5" size="100,100">The door doesn&#39;t budge and you start to regret sleeping in class.

&quot;I&#39;m pretty sure you&#39;re supposed to pull right, just saying.&quot;

You turn around and see a fellow AY-mazing contestant behind you, smiling at you. 

&#39;Gee thanks,&#39; You mutter as you start to get competitive. You can&#39;t afford to have someone tail you like that, what if they pick up on a detail you didn&#39;t and win?

You shake your head and clear the doubts.

[[You pull the door to the right.-&gt; Open]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="16" name="Choices - Math" tags="" position="2029,185" size="100,100">You stare at the map and contemplate which exhibit is most likely to hold the keyword.

[[The cyberpunk aesthetic of the Computers and Technology exhibit looks stunning. Could the keyword be on a neon sign there?-&gt;Computers and Technology]]

[[The miniature concert hall has potential. What if the elegant hall is handing out music sheets that have the keyword on there?-&gt;Music]]

[[There must be something I missed in the main hall, let&#39;s go back and check.-&gt;Hall]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="17" name="Hall" tags="" position="1255,382.5" size="100,100">You look around the vast entrance hall again. Surely there&#39;s something you missed?

You sit down at the couch provided near the doors and observe your surroundings. 

The workers all have small goose enamel pins, which reminded you of the weird goose model that was on the ceiling. Could it be a clue?

You dash under the model and squint, trying to find anything that might give you a keyword.

&quot;Oh, you&#39;re still here?&quot; The previous worker who welcomed you noted, smiling at you.

&#39;Yeah, um... is that model up there related to the keyword?&#39; 

&quot;Maybe, I&#39;m not exactly sure myself. However, there&#39;s a plate over there that talks about the model. Try checking that out.&quot;

Excited, you run over to the plate. A QR code is on the plate and you scan it, bringing you to a &lt;A HREF = &quot;https://alex-cen.github.io/STEMazing-Race/&quot;&gt;website&lt;/A&gt;.

You finish the website and you wonder to yourself.
